Open edX Events from Hooks Extensions Framework (`OEP-50`_).

.. _OEP-50: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oep-0050-hooks-extension-framework.html

Purpose
*******

This repository implements the necessary tooling and definitions used by the
Hooks Extension Framework to manage the events execution and extra tools.

Getting Started with Development
********************************

Please see the Open edX documentation for `guidance on Python development <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/how-tos/get-ready-for-python-dev.html>`_ in this repo.

Deploying
*********

The Open edX Events component is a Python library which doesn't need independent deployment. Therefore,
its setup is reasonably straightforward. First, it needs to be added to your service requirements,
and then it will be installed alongside requirements of the service.

If the service you intend to use is either the LMS or CMS, then the library is installed alongside
their requirements since the Maple release.
