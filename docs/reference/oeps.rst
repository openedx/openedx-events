Open edX Proposals
###################

Here we list the Open edX proposals used throughout the project that will help
you understand the major decisions made during the library's design.

- The `Hooks extension framework (OEP-50)`_ specifies its motivation, implementation details, rationale, performance considerations, general use cases, and more. The goal of the OEP-50 is to give the extensions' developer a glance at the framework implementation and design.

- The `Asynchronous Server Event Message Format (OEP-41)`_ specifies the header information format sent by the events. For a detailed description at the impact of the OEP-41, please refer to the Events Payload ADR.
